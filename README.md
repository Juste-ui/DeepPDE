# Deep parametric PDE  Method (DeepPDE)

This code provides an example accompanying work in progress on the deep parmetirc PDE method joint with Kathrin Glau (and funded by EPSRC grant EP/T004738/1), solving a European basket call option with two underlying assets in Black-Scholes model.

It provides the pre-trained network as used in the article and methods to train your own model.

Usage: Open the Notebook DeepParametricPDEExample.ipynb in the folder "TwoAssetsExample". To run the code yourself, open in in Google Colab or on your computer using jupyter.
